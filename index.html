CODETIC is a tutorial website that helps you to understand what is css and html.
Websites have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be a personal website, a
 commercial website, a government website or a non-profit organization website. Websites can be the work of
 an individual, a business or other organization, and are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose.
 Any website can contain a hyperlink to any other website, so the distinction between individual sites, as perceived 
 by the user, can be blurred. Websites are written in, or converted to, HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and are accessed 
 using a software interface classified as a user agent. Web pages can be viewed or otherwise accessed from a range of computer-based
 and Internet-enabled devices of various sizes, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones. A website is hosted on a
 computer system known as a web server, also called an HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) server. These terms can also refer to the software that 
 runs on these systems which retrieves and delivers the web pages in response to requests from the website's users. Apache is the most commonly used 
 web server software (according to Netcraft statistics) and Microsoft's IIS is also commonly used. 
Some alternatives, such as Nginx, Lighttpd, Hiawatha or Cherokee, are fully functional and lightweight.

<h1 class="title">THE IMPORTANCE OF CSS</h1>
<p class="details">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSS is important. And it is being used more and more often. Cascading 
Style Sheets offer many advantages you don’t have in table-layouts - and first
 of all a strict separation between layout, or design of the page, and the information, 
 presented on the page. Thus the design of pages can be easily changed, just replacing a 
 css-file with another one. Isn’t it great? Well, actualy, it is. Over the last few years web-developers
 have written many articles about CSS and developed many useful techniques, which can save you a lot of time -
 of course, if you are able to find them in time. Below you’ll find a list of techniques we ,
 as web-architects, really couldn’t live without. They are essential and they indeed make our life easier.

<p class="details2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short for HyperText Markup Language, the authoring language used to create
 documents on the World Wide Web. HTML is similar to SGML, although it is not a strict 
subset. HTML defines the structure and layout of a Web document by using a variety of
 tags and attributes.
 HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the 
 World Wide Web. Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks. ...
 HTML code ensures the proper formatting
 of text and images so that your Internet browser may display them as they are intended to look.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML is the acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a form of programming language 
that is used to make web pages on the internet viewable. So it can be said that it 
is because of HTML that web pages are interesting to look at, but the importance of HTML is often taken for granted.
HTML, as a markup language doesn't really “do” anything in the sense that a programming language does. 
HTML contains no programming logic. It doesn't have common conditional statements
 such as If/Else. ... This is because HTML is not a programming language.
HTML is basically used for designing purposes, it is used to design webpages,interfaces for various mobile 
applications and web applications. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is used to create web pages.
HTML is a fairly straightforward and simple language to learn. ... That by itself is enough to make learning 
JavaScript a lot more difficult than HTML. While a markup language describes what something is, 
a programming language defines a series of actions to be performed.
