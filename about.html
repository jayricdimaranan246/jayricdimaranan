<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CODETIC is refers to a central location that contains more than one web page or a series of web 
pages. For example, Computer Hope is considered a 
website, which contains thousands of different web pages, 
including the page you're reading now.
Websites have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be a personal website, a 
commercial website, a government website or a non-profit organization website. Websites can be the work of 
an individual, a business or other organization, and are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose. 
Any website can contain a hyperlink to any other website, so the distinction between individual sites, as perceived 
by the user, can be blurred. Websites are written in, or converted to, HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and are accessed
 using a software interface classified as a user agent. Web pages can be viewed or otherwise accessed from a range of 
 computer-based and Internet-enabled devices of various sizes, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.
 A website is hosted on a computer system known as a web server, also called an HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) server. 
 These terms can also refer to the software that runs on these systems which retrieves and delivers the web pages in response 
 to requests from the website's users. Apache is the most commonly used web server software (according to Netcraft statistics) 
 and Microsoft's IIS is also commonly used. 
Some alternatives, such as Nginx, Lighttpd, Hiawatha or Cherokee, are fully functional and lightweight.
Websites can be divided into two broad categoriesâ€”static and interactive. Interactive sites are part of the Web 2.0 community of sites, and allow 
for interactivity between the site owner and site visitors or users. Static sites serve or capture information but do not allow engagement with the audience or users directly. Some websites are informational or produced by enthusiasts or for personal use or entertainment. Many websites do aim to make money, using one or more business models, including:

Posting interesting content and selling contextual advertising either through direct sales or through an advertising network.
E-commerce: products or services are purchased directly through the website
Advertising products or services available at a brick and mortar business
Freemium: basic content is available for free but premium content requires a payment (e.g., WordPress website, it is an open
 source platform to build a blog or website.)
There are many varieties of websites, each specializing in a particular type of content or use, and they may be arbitrarily 
classified in any number of ways. A few such classifications might include:

CODETIC is a tutorial website that brings all people to make a knowledge and experience in programming.Programming is the art and science of translating a set of ideas into a program - a list of instructions a computer can follow. The person writing a program is known as a programmer (also a coder).

The exact form the instructions take depend on the Programming Language used. Languages run the 
spectrum from very low level like Machine 
Language or Assembly, to a very high level like Java. Lower level languages are more closely tied to 
the platform they are targeted for, while Higher level languages abstract an increasing amount of the platform from the programmer.

In other words, low level programming languages represent the instructions in a manner that resembles more closely the way the computer 
actually works. High level languages do resemble more the way the human mind works. Each type is a good fit depending on the particular
 case. Whenever speed and resource consumption are important, low level languages can provide an advantage since they cause much less
 "translation" and are less generic, thus causing less load on the computer. High level languages have much more abstraction and thus 
 are better suited for tasks where maintenance and complex design is required.

After a programmer has finished writing the program, it must be executed. Traditionally, some languages (like Basic) are interpreted, while 
others (like C) are compiled prior to execution. Interpreted languages are executed "on the fly" at run time, while compiled languages
 have a separate compilation step that must be completed prior to running. Compilers are able to make certain optimizations that are unavailable 
 to interpreters.

The program may fail to compile or execute due to syntax errors. These are errors caused by doing something that is unknown or illegal according to
 the language they have used. These errors have to be corrected before the program will execute.

If the program runs, the programmer must then verify that the program is working as they intended it to. When things 
don't go as the programmer intended, the error is said to be a bug. To eliminate bugs, the programmer goes through a process 
called debugging, where he tries to isolate and fix the source of the problem.

He is from Brgy Calumpang Tayabas City.Rama said"The process of developing and implementing various sets of 
instructions to enable a computer to do a certain task. These instructions are considered computer programs and help the computer
 to operate smoothly. The language used to program computers is not understood by an untrained eye."
