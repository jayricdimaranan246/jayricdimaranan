<p><b>Gmail</b>- Google's mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes, including to filter 
spam and malware, and to add context-sensitive advertisements next to emails. This advertising practice has been s
ignificantly criticized by privacy advocates due to concerns over unlimited data retention, ease of monitoring by 
third parties, users of other email providers not having agreed to the policy upon sending emails to Gmail addresses, 
and the potential for Google to change its policies to further decrease privacy by combining information with other 
Google data usage. The company has been the subject of lawsuits concerning the issues. Google has stated that email 
users must "necessarily expect" their emails to be subject to automated processing and claims that the service refrains 
from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages, such as those mentioning race, religion, sexual orientation, 
health, or financial statements. In June 2017, Google announced the upcoming end to the use of contextual Gmail content for
 advertising purposes,
 relying instead on data gathered from the use of its other services

<p><b>Youtube</b>- 
YouTube earns advertising revenue from Google AdSense, a 
program which targets ads according to site content and audience. The vast majority of its videos a
re free to view, but there are exceptions, including subscription-based premium channels, film rentals,
 as well as YouTube Premium, a subscription service offering ad-free access to the website and access to
 exclusive content made in partnership with existing users.

</p>
<p><b>Facebook</b>- 
The Facebook service can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, 
such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After registering, users can 
create a customized profile revealing information about themselves. Users can post text,
photos and multimedia of their own devising and share it with other users as "friends". Users can use
 various embedded apps, and receive notifications of their friends'
 activities. Users may join common-interest groups.
